# cheap-flight_tracker
API used: Tequila by Kiwi, Sheety, Twilio

It helps you to track the best deals for flights to desired destinations placed in Google sheet
where you have to put cities and desired price in columns 'Cities' and 'Lowest Price'

Also you should ad column 'IATA Code' (can be left unfulled, tracker will do it)

As a default, search engine works with dates from tomorrow to 6 month and number of nights to stay from 7 to 14

If search engine find something with lower price, it will send a SMS to your phone number
